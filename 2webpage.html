      <pre>  it's TRUE! YES,I HAVE BEEN ILL, <br>
        very ill. But why do you say that I have lost control of my mind <br>
        why do you say that i am mad ? Can you nat see that i have full control of my mind ? <br>
        is it not clear taht iam not mad ? indeed, the illness only made my mind, my feelings, my senses <br>
        stronger, more powerful. My senses of hearing especially became more powerful i could hear sounds i had never
        heard before. i heard sounds from heaven; and i heard sounds from hell <br></pre>
