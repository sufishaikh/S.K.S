      The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for
      documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      such as JavaScript. <br />
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      the appearance of the document. <br />
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
      images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into
      the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
      denoting structural semantics for <br />
      text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
      HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags
      such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. Other tags
      such as p surround and provide information <br />
      about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers
      do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the
      page. HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
      JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion
      of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web
      Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of
      the CSS standards, <br />
      CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]

      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
      HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside
      HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the separation of
      presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
      separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and
      control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable
      multiple web pages to share formatting <br />
      by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces
      complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling
      the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
      pages that share the file and its formatting.

      JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted,
      object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as
      the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser
      environments as well. ... JavaScript can function as both a procedural and
      an object oriented language. <br />
      JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design
      / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event.
      JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language,
      widely used for controlling web page behavior. Contrary to popular
      misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". In a nutshell,
      JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based
      object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both
      Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the
      language. Language constructs, <br />
      such as if statements, for and while loops, and switch and try ... catch
      blocks function the same as in these languages (or nearly so).
