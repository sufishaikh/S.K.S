      <u><b>Spirit of Worship</b></u>
      <pre>
According to Jainism, there was a frog in a pond in Rajgiri City. <br>
 Once there came the Samosharan of Lord Mahaveera. All the citizens went to worship Lord Mahaveera. <br>
  The frog also made up his mind to worship. The frog took a lotus petal in his mouth and set out <br>
   towards Samosharan. King Srenik was also going towards the Samosharan riding on his elephant. <br>
    When the frog was crossing the way, suddenly the elephant stamped the frog. It died at once <br>
     By the spirit of worship, the frog became a god in the heaven and immediately came down in the <br>
      Samosharan and worshiped Lord Mahaveera. So when a frog can take birth in heaven by the spirit <br>
       of worship, then why will human being not get happiness and peace by worshipping God?</pre>
